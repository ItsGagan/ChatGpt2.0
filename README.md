# ChatGpt2.0

After falling in love ❤️ with ChatGPT, getting across the GPT3 API on which the chatgpt rolled out..I undertook a project to build a clone of ChatGPT, a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. Using my expertise in Tailwind CSS, ReactJS, and Vite, I built a high-quality, responsive user interface that provides an intuitive and seamless user experience.
